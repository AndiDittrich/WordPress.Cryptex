Cryptex transforms plain-text E-Mail-Addresses into Images - automatically

== Description ==

The Cryptex plugin for WordPress is used to display email addresses - that are normally expressed in plain text - as an image automatically.
It works with telephone numbers, postal addresses also.
Just wrap your E-Mail-Address into a shortcode like `[email]youraddress@example.com[/email]` - that's it. Or use the **Autodetect** filter to transform every E-Mail-Address on your page automatically into an image!

= Plugin Features =
* Fully customizable appearance: you can configure font-family, font-size and font-color - everything looks like your theme style
* Shortcode and/or Autodetection usage!
* Build-In E-Mail-Address-Autodetection - all addresses on your page are protected automatically (if you want it - you can also just use shortcodes!)
* Autodetection filters configurable for **the_content**, **the_excerpt**, **comments**, **comments_excerpt**
* Reversible Address-Autodetection Process - your content is modified aslong the plugin is activated
* Also useable to protect postal-addresses, telephone-numbers, names and other sensitive informations
* Protects E-Mail hyperlinks (mailto) by using javascript based key-shifting encryption/decryption with dynamic keys - but you can use images only
* Suitable for high traffic sites - automated caching of dynamic generated images and CSS
* Native support for MooTools and jQuery is given - all other frameworks/browsers are supported by generic javascript code
* Automatic font-search (standard system font-paths)
* Supports the new modern UI style of WordPress 3.8

= Text-Transformations =
The @-sign as well as dot's within the e-mail-addresses can be automatically replaced by different placeholders, e.g. `mail(at)example{dot}org`, to match your website's corporate design.

= Security Modes =
Cryptex provides various obfuscation modes for E-Mail-Addresses:

* Plain Text - only text-transformations are applied - no use of images
* Single Image - the e-mail-address is expressed as a single image 
* Multipart Image - the e-mail-address is splitted into two images, seperated by the @-sign in plain text
* Advanced Multipart Image - the craziest one: each part (divided by dot's and @ sign) is displayed as a seperate image, the dividers as plain text


= UPGRADE NOTICE to 3.x =
Most of your custom **cryptex plugin settings** get lost on upgrading to the 3.x branch beacause of the new plugin backend structure - please backup them on your own.
    
== Installation ==

= System requirements =
* PHP 5.3 or greater
* GD library (v2.0.28 or greater)
* GD PNG support

= Installation =
1. Upload the complete `cryptex` folder (Wordpress Plugin) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings -> Cryptex and check all items.
4. After checking your environment (GD installed) you have to set your font-source. If the source is invalid try another one or upload fonts into the `/wp-content/plugins/cryptex/fonts/` directory and use **Plugin Directory** as font-source
5. Now - all items should be marked green, this means Cryptex is ready for use.
6. Go to the appearance section and select the *font-family*, *font-color* and *font-size* like the styles in your theme
7. You can also use your own/special fonts uploading them into the `/wp-content/plugins/cryptex/fonts/` directory and use this as font-source
8. That's it! You're done. You can now enter the following code into a post or page to protect email addresses: [email]youraddress@example.com[/email]

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I get an error using the system font paths, which are shown by the settings page =

This pathes - depending on your hosting environment - can be different - if you don't know the path, please ask your hosting provider or upload the fonts manually into the cryptex-plugin-directory `\wp-content\plugins\cryptex\fonts\` and use **Plugin Directory** as font source.

= I get a "file permission" error changing the font source to **Custom Directoy** =

During security restrictions your system font paths could be unaccessable. In this case you have to upload TrueTypeFonts (.ttf) into the cryptex-plugin-directory `\wp-content\plugins\cryptex\fonts\` and use **Plugin Directory** as font source.

= I get an "file permission" php error in my blog =

The directory `/wp-content/plugins/cryptex/cache/` must be writeable - the images as well as the generated css file will be stored there

= I need bold/italic font styles =
Please use the italic/bold font of the font family you've selected. For example there is an verdana.ttf(normal) and verdanai.ttf(italic) file!

= Is it possible to use Cryptex directly in my wordpress template ? shortcode does not work yet =
Of course! you can simply use `<?php Cryptex::crypt('yourtext'); ?>` to display 'yourtext' as crypted version

== Changelog ==

= 3.2.1 =
* Bugfix: CSS files doesn't get generated on upgrading the plugin - you have to click "save settings" to force the creation on previuos versions 

= 3.2 =
* Added: Autodetection filters for `get_the_excerpt`, `get_comment_text` and `get_comment_excerpt`
* Added: New Security-Mode "Advanced Multipart Image" - each part of the email-address (seperated by dot's and @ sign) is displayed as an image, the dividers as plain text
* Added: New Security-Mode "Text" - not recommended but usefull if you don't want to use images (e.g. screenreaders required) - this setting will only modify the @sign of the text and adds mailto
